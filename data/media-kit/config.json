  "bio": "We're the Bogdzewic family and we live full-time in a converted school bus (skoolie) traveling across North America. I'm Kal, and I document our journey of raising a family on the road -- the beautiful sunsets AND the frozen water tanks at 3am. From skoolie conversion tutorials and van life tips to honest looks at what it really takes to live mobile with kids, our content resonates with anyone who's dreamed of trading the mortgage for the open road. We've been on the road for over two years and have built a passionate community of families, aspiring nomads, and DIY enthusiasts who follow along for the real, unfiltered version of alternative living.",
